Getting Funded on Kickstarter

This data set is from Kaggle; explanation can be found at
https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/funding-successful-projects#test.csv



WHO THIS DATASET IS FOR

This dataset is for all teams for Projects 3 (Explain) and 4 (Predict). Note this is for live presenters and video submitters.

Note: Teams presenting live are not required to upload your presentations to the hub, but please do bring hardcopies of the relevant views of your presentation. 

Whether presenting live or submitting video, all presentations must be 8 minutes or less.



ABOUT THE DATA 

There are three files given to download: train.csv, test.csv and sample_submission.csv The train data consists of sample projects from the May 2009 to May 2015. The test data consists of projects from June 2015 to March 2017.

See the URL above for explanations of the data.


BACKGROUND

Kickstarter is a community of more than 10 million people comprising of creative, tech enthusiasts who help in bringing creative project to life. Till now, more than $3 billion dollars have been contributed by the members in fueling creative projects. The projects can be literally anything – a device, a game, an app, a film etc.

Kickstarter works on all or nothing basis i.e if a project doesn’t meet it goal, the project owner gets nothing. For example: if a projects’s goal is $500. Even if it gets funded till $499, the project won’t be a success.

Recently, Kickstarter released its public data repository to allow researchers and enthusiasts like us to help them solve a problem. Will a project get fully funded ?



BRIEF

In this challenge, you have to first (a) explain why and then (b) predict if a project will get successfully funded or not.



PROJECT 3: EXPLAIN

As discussed in class, the explain project is about a combination of exploration, hypothesis, and hypothesis testing to explain the focal relationship as much as is possible with the dataset.

To be ready to do this project, you will need to lay a foundation by doing the describe and evaluate steps of the project, but you will not translate that work into full presentations as we did in the first 2 projects. Instead, summarise that work in a few pages and save time to present your explanation of the focal relationship.

To provide an explanation of the explanation relationship, you should perform at least a logistic regression, but feel free to use other methods as well. In your models, focus not just on explained variance, but also on highlighting variables with larger main effects or collections of variables that have interaction effect that are both statistically and substantively significant -- i.e., practically important to entrepreneurs and inventors seeking to raise money on kickstarter.  

Here are some tips for your presentation:  
1. Begin with the context: the project aim, what you did, and what you hope to achieve  
2. Summary of what you will show
3. Interesting patterns you saw in describing the data 
4. Opportunities and limitations you noted in evaluating what you can say with the data 
4. Hypotheses you derived from the describe and evaluate
5. Features of the data that have implications for model selection
6. The model(s) you ran and the results you got
7. What this means for kickstarter users (entrepreneurs) 



PROJECT 2: PREDICT

As we will discuss in lecture, the predict project is about making a prediction believable enough that people will act on it — potentially changing their plans or habits to leverage new insights.  

To make an interesting prediction, you should do an explainable decision tree model that suits the data and gets you a good mix of accuracy and explainability.
 
Here are some tips for your presentation:  
1. Recap the context: the problem, what you did last week, and where you will take it today   
2. Executive summary of what you will show
3. Give any refinements of the problem you want to make
4. The models you considered, the model you chose, and why 
5. How you did the model
6. Your results
7. What it means (including limitations)
